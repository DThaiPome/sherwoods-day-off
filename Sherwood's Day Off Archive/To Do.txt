After some time, GW will attempt to crush Sherwood by leaping atop him, and upon missing will struggle to rise again, allowing Sherwood to jump on his back and break his stone armor.

This sequence repeats until GW has been his six times, at which he is defeated.

He cannot be attacked directly, and his sheer size mostly protects him from being stomped on by Sherwood. He begins by launching streams of fire at either high or low heights, forcing Sherwood to either jump or duck to avoid them. After this, MU begins to launch bouncing fireballs at Sherwood must carefully dance around. After some time, MU's flamethrower runs low on power, and the fireballs turn into barely-warm rocks, allowing Sherwood to jump on them and then on MU to deal damage. After being struck, MU runs to the other side of the arena, shoots some balls of fire into the air, and then later launches a colossal bomb that destroyes the platform of the arena. On this event's first occurrence, MU and Sherwood are dropped deeper into the Volcano, and now the bouncing fireballs leave a temporary trail of fire on the floor that damages Sherwood. In the final phase, after destroying the floor once more, MU and Sherwood fall into the core of the Volcano, where the floor breaks up into separate platforms upon hitting the magma pool. After being stomped on one final time, MU is finally defeated, and Sherwood rescues the Red Cardinal.

In each phase of the fight, Lizzit throws several shurikens in varying patterns from the corner of the arena, striking Sherwood if he gets too close. Eventually, Lizzit switches her strategy and fastens her long tongue to a pole while swinging around and attacking Sherwood with her spines. At this point, attacking her tounge will deal damage, cause lizzit to move on to the next stage of the fight, and force Sherwood to chase her down. At the next stage, there are only two platforms off to the sides of the arena, and at the third and final stage there are no platforms and Sherwood must rely entirely on the poles.
