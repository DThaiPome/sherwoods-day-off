## Overview

***Sherwood's Day Off*** was my passion project during a high school summer vacation, motivated by my unending enthusiasm for platformer games. It was a very ambitious idea; platformers are very tricky to develop, particularly with the limited, mostly self-taught experience I had at the time. The project would never get past the prototype stage, which is now not very surprising, although someday I hope to revisit the idea with my newfound experience. 

If you want to try it out, there is an executable in the repository. Here is some info, since the game itself is not very communicative:

- Move with WASD or the arrow keys.
- Jump with the spacebar. After leaving the ground or bouncing off something, you can jump two more times, although with less height.
- Attack by right clicking. The "attack" is just a grey rectangle that appears next to your character. Any "enemies" (usually big red or white squares) that touch it will disappear.
- You can move faster by holding shift, but your speed can only change if you are on the ground (of all the weird things with this game, this is actually intentional).
- You have to "attack" the purple squares to collect them.
- A floating yellow star will teleport you to a sort of bonus round, where you have to collect all of the blue squares before time runs out. A purple square will spawn somewhere once you collect all the blue squares, and you have to attack it to leave.
- Lots of things are broken, I made this a long time ago when I was still learning and it was largely for fun. If something doesn't make sense, it's probably because of that.

## Concept

I admittedly put a lot more effort into designing the levels than making sure the code functioned properly. I took a lot of inspiration from the Donkey Kong Country games. Other than that, it's a fairly generic platformer; run, jump, and collect things.

I also had a lot of ideas for concepts for levels and whatnot. I was very imaginative, although lots of the ideas were stolen from other games I had played. I was very young when I made this.
