## Overview

***Sherwood's Day Off*** was my passion project during a high school summer vacation, motivated by my unending enthusiasm for platformer games. It was a very ambitious idea; platformers are very tricky to develop, particularly with the limited, mostly self-taught experience I had at the time. The project would never get past the prototype stage, unfortunately, although someday I hope to revisit the idea with my newfound experience.
